        <div class="header">Explaining the strategy around testing the REST API</div>
        We tested the a few calls in Postman, GET and POST.
        <br>
        The main way we tested the API and backend was with a local database.
        <br>
        Backend we tested by making test classes 'mains' in the project (these are deleted again - mistake)
        <br>
        With these methods we send and withdrew data to and from the DB.
        <br>
        The way we tested was:
        <br>
        1. making an object -> sending this object to the JPA -> making a Persist og Query call with JPA og JPQL.
        <br>
        We did not find the time to make a JUnit-test.
