        We made two error code responses.
        <br>
        404: is send whenever we make a input check. If the input check returns a null value it will throw a 404 exception.
        <br>
        Furthermore a 404 will be thrown if you  for example try to call a rest call with a wrong path.
        <br>
        500: is thrown if a backend exception is thrown, like you try to access a person with a ID that doesnt exist in the DB.
